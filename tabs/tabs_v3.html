The '''Georgia Institute of Technology''' (commonly called '''Georgia Tech''', '''Tech''', and '''GT''') is a [[public university|public]], coeducational [[research university]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in the United States. It is a part of the [[University System of Georgia]] and has satellite campuses in [[Savannah, Georgia]]; [[Metz]], France; [[Athlone]], Ireland; [[Shanghai]], China; and [[Singapore]].

The educational institution was founded in 1885 as the Georgia School of Technology as part of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] plans to build an industrial economy in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Southern United States]]. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a [[Vocational school|trade school]] to a larger and more capable [[Institute of technology|technical institute]] and research university. Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31&nbsp;departments/units, with a strong emphasis on science and technology. It is most recognized for its degree programs in engineering, computing, and the sciences, but also offers degrees in architecture, liberal arts, and management.

Georgia Tech's main campus occupies a large part of [[Midtown Atlanta]], bordered by 10th Street to the north and by [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]] to the south, placing it well in sight of the [[Atlanta#Cityscape|Atlanta skyline]]. In 1996, the campus was the site of the athletes' village and a venue for a number of athletic events for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Whereas, previously, the Midtown location placed Georgia Tech students in the middle of one of the highest metropolitan crime-rate areas in America, the construction of the Olympic village along with subsequent [[gentrification]] of the surrounding areas greatly increased public safety.

Student athletics, both organized and intramural, are an important part of student and alumni life. The school's [[college athletics|intercollegiate competitive sports]] teams, the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]], and the nationally recognized fight song "[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]", have helped keep Georgia Tech in the national spotlight. Georgia Tech fields 8 men's and 7 women's teams that compete in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics and the [[Division I-A#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]]. Georgia Tech is a member of the Coastal Division in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].

The idea of a technology school in Georgia was introduced in 1865 during the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period. Two former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officers, Major [[John Fletcher Hanson]] (an industrialist) and [[Nathaniel Edwin Harris]] (a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens in the town of [[Macon, Georgia]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], strongly believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the [[industrial revolution]] that was occurring throughout the North.<ref name="Hopkins">{{cite web | title = The Hopkins Administration, 1888–1895 | work = "A Thousand Wheels are set in Motion": The Building of Georgia Tech at the Turn of the 20th Century, 1888–1908 | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | url = http://www.library.gatech.edu/gtbuildings/hopkins.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref><ref name="gws">{{cite web|url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/1293.pdf|title=The George W.

In 1882, the [[Georgia State Legislature]] authorized a committee, led by Harris, to visit the Northeast to see firsthand how technology schools worked. They were impressed by educational models developed at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science (now [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]]). The committee recommended adapting the Worcester model, which stressed a combination of "theory and practice", the "practice" component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.<ref name="NewSouthCreed">{{cite journal | last = Brittain | first = James E. | coauthors = Robert C.

On October 13, 1885, [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia Governor]] [[Henry D. McDaniel]] signed the bill to create and fund the new school.<ref name="walk"/> In 1887, Atlanta pioneer [[Richard Peters (Atlanta)|Richard Peters]] donated {{convert|4|acre|ha}} of his extensive land holdings to the state;<ref name="walk"/> this land was bounded on the south by [[North Avenue (Atlanta)|North Avenue]], and on the west by Cherry Street.<ref name="walk"/> He then sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for [[United States dollar|US$]]10,000,<ref name="walk"/> equivalent to about US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1887|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=2}}}} now. This land was located near the northern city limits of Atlanta at the time of its founding, although the city has now expanded several miles beyond it. A historical marker on the large hill in [[Georgia Institute of Technology#Central Campus|Central Campus]] notes that the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications built to protect Atlanta during the [[Atlanta Campaign]] of the [[American Civil War]]. The surrender of the city took place on the southwestern boundary of the modern Georgia Tech campus in 1864.<ref name="CivilWarAtlanta">{{cite web | last = Lenz | first = Richard J. | title = Surrender Marker, Fort Hood, Change of Command Marker | work = The Civil War in Georgia, An Illustrated Travelers Guide | publisher = Sherpa Guides | year = 2002 | month = November | url = http://sherpaguides.com/georgia/civil_war/atlanta/westview_area.html | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref>

The Georgia School of Technology opened its doors in the fall of 1888 with two buildings.<ref name="Hopkins"/> One building (now [[Tech Tower]], an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a [[foundry]], [[forge]], [[mechanical room|boiler room]], and engine room. It was designed specifically for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands;<ref name="Hopkins"/> though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.<ref name="NewSouthCreed"/>

On October 20, 1905, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited the Georgia Tech campus. On the steps of Tech Tower, Roosevelt delivered a speech about the importance of technological education.<ref name="PresidentialVisit">{{cite web | last = Selman | first = Sean | title = Presidential Tour of Campus Not the First for the Institute | work = A Presidential Visit to Georgia Tech | publisher = Georgia Institute of Technology | date = 2002-03-27 | url = http://www.gatech.edu/presidential-visit/presidential-history.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080202173719/http://www.gatech.edu/presidential-visit/presidential-history.html | archivedate = 2008-02-02 | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref> He then shook hands with every student.<ref name="EventfulYear">{{cite web | title = One Hundred Years Ago Was Eventful Year at Tech | work = BuzzWords | publisher = [[Georgia Tech Alumni Association]] | date = 2005-10-01 | url = http://gtalumni.org/buzzwords/oct05/article389.html | accessdate = 2006-12-30 }}</ref>

=== Modern history ===
Founded as the Georgia School of Technology, Georgia Tech assumed its present name in 1948 to reflect a growing focus on advanced technological and scientific research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/about/history.html|title=History & Traditions|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> Unlike most similarly-named universities (such as the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]]), the Georgia Institute of Technology is a [[public university|public]] institution.

</ref> There was little reaction to this by Tech students; like the city of Atlanta described by former Mayor [[William Hartsfield]], they seemed "too busy to hate".<ref name="notsoeasy"/> Similarly, there was little student reaction to the [[Vietnam War]] and United States involvement in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. The student council defeated a resolution supporting the [[Vietnam Moratorium]], and the extent of the Tech community's response to the [[Kent State shooting]] was limited to a student-organized memorial service, though the Institute was ordered closed for two days, along with all other [[University System of Georgia]] schools.<ref name="ens"/>

In 1988, President [[John Patrick Crecine]] pushed through a restructuring of the university. The Institute at that point had three colleges: the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Management|College of Management]], and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal Arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing|College of Computing]], the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Sciences|College of Sciences]], and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs.<ref name="Crecine">{{cite news | last = Joshi | first = Nikhil | title = Geibelhaus lectures on controversial president | work = [[The Technique]] | date = 2006-03-10 | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-03-10/focus/4 | accessdate = 2007-01-29 | quote = There was controversy in every step.

The student body consists of more than 20,000 graduate and undergraduate students (Winter 2009) and more than 900 full-time instructional faculty (October 2008).<ref name="Fall09Enroll"/><ref name="FacCount"/><ref name="Facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/about/factsandfigures.html|title=Facts and Figures|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> As is historically true of engineering institutions, female enrollment at Georgia Tech is low. With about twice as many male students as females, Georgia Tech has one of the most unbalanced male-to-female ratios of any [[coeducation|co-ed]] university. However, this is slowly changing due to the university's growing liberal arts programs and outreach programs to encourage more female high school students to consider careers in science and engineering. These include the "Women In Engineering" program and sponsorship of a chapter of The [[Society of Women Engineers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.gatech.edu/diversity/wieabout.php|title=Women in Engineering at Georgia Tech|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|Georgia Tech College of Engineering]]|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/swe/|title=Welcome!|publisher=Georgia Tech Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> {{As of|2009|alt=As of Spring 2009}}, the freshman class of 2008–2009 had a ratio of 67.4% to 32.2%.<ref name="ratio">{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/apps/Enrollment/gender.cfm?TERM=200902&time_status=Total|title=Facts and Figures: Enrollment by Gender|publisher=Georgia Tech Office of Institutional Research & Planning|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> The highest freshman ratio in the past few years (counting only Fall and Spring semesters)<ref>A slightly higher percentage of freshmen women attend during Summer.

=== Industry connections ===
Owing to its roots as a [[vocational school|trade school]], Georgia Tech maintains close ties to the industrial world. Many of these connections are made through Georgia Tech's [[cooperative education]] and [[intern]]ship programs.

The Undergraduate Cooperative Education Program is a five-year program in which [[undergraduate education|undergraduate students]] alternate between semesters of formal instruction at Georgia Tech and semesters of full-time employment with their employers. 

The Graduate Cooperative Education Program, established in 1983, is the largest such program in the United States.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.gradcoop.gatech.edu/ | work=Division of Professional Practice | title=Graduate Cooperative Education Program | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | accessdate = 2007-09-24 }}</ref> It allows [[graduate school|graduate students]] pursuing [[master's degree]]s or [[doctorate]]s in any field to spend a maximum of two consecutive semesters working full- or part-time with employers. The Undergraduate Professional Internship Program enables undergraduate students—typically juniors or seniors—to complete a one- or two-semester internship with employers. The Work Abroad Program hosts a variety of cooperative education and internship experiences for upperclassmen and graduate students seeking international employment and cross-cultural experiences. While all four programs are voluntary, they consistently attract high numbers of students—more than 3,000 at last count. Around 1,000 businesses and organizations hire these students, who collectively earn $20 million per year.<ref name="DoPPhome"/>

Georgia Tech Housing is subject to a clear geographic division of campus into eastern and western areas that contain the vast majority of housing. East Campus is largely populated by freshmen and is served by [[Brittain Dining Hall]]. West Campus houses some freshmen, transfer, and returning students (upperclassmen), and is served by Woodruff Dining Hall.<ref name=brittain>{{cite web|url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/20557|title=Dedication of Renovated Brittain Dining Hall Notes|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Library]]|date=2001-10-19|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegeprowler.com/georgia-tech/campus-dining/|title=Georgia Tech - Campus Dining|work=[[College Prowler]]|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref> Graduate students typically live off-campus (for example, in [[Home Park (Atlanta)|Home Park]]) or on-campus in the Graduate Living Center or 10th and Home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housing.gatech.edu/reshalls/index.cfm|title=Residence Halls|publisher=Georgia Tech Housing|accessdate=2010-02-26}}</ref>

In the fall of 2007, the North Avenue Apartments were opened to Tech students. Originally built for the 1996 Olympics and belonging to [[Georgia State University]], the buildings were gifted to Georgia Tech and have been used to accommodate Tech's expanding population, although Georgia Tech freshmen students were the first to inhabit the dormitories in the Winter and Spring 1996 quarters, while much of East Campus was under renovation for the Olympics. The North Avenue Apartments (commonly known as "North Ave") are also noted as the first Georgia Tech buildings to rise above the top of Tech Tower. Open to second-year undergraduate students and above, the buildings are located on East Campus, across North Avenue and near Bobby Dodd Stadium, putting more upperclassmen on East Campus.<ref name="NAA">{{ cite news | work=[[The Technique]] | publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology | url=http://dev.nique.gatech.edu/issues/2007-03-09/news/1 | accessdate=2008-06-14 | date=2007-03-09 | title=Tech acquires Ga.

Tech has a number of legends and traditions, some of which have persisted for decades. Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from [[Tech Tower]]. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters "TECH" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully. The latest instance of this tradition occurred in October 2005, when a replica of the T was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.<ref>{{cite news

Georgia Tech holds a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the [[University of Georgia]], known as [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]]. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be "[[old gold]], black, and crimson". [[Charles Herty|Dr. Charles H. Herty]], the first UGA football coach, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it "symbolized cowardice". After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/traditions/school_colors.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060614073737/http://georgiadogs.collegesports.com/traditions/school_colors.html|archivedate=2006-06-14|title=School Colors, Stolen Girl Friends, and Yellow Jacket Treachery|first=Mike|last=Cheatham|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref><ref name="ugacolors">{{cite web | first = Brandon | last = German | title = Official school colors | work = College Football Tradition | publisher = 1122productions.com | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] in 1891.<ref name="rw">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Athletic Association]]|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.

[[File:Burgerbowl.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the [[Burger Bowl]], facing south|alt=A grassy field surrounded by large, green-leafed trees and bushes. A sidewalk cuts through the field horizontally. A large red brick and white concrete building with idealized smoke stacks is in the background to the left, as are a few other less visible buildings.]]
West Campus is occupied primarily by apartments and coed undergraduate dormitories. Prominent apartments include [[Hemphill Avenue Apartments|Crecine]], [[Center Street Apartments|Center Street]], 6th Street, Maulding, [[Undergraduate Living Center]] (ULC), and [[Eighth Street Apartments]]. Prominent dorms include [[Freeman Hall (Georgia Tech)|Freeman]], [[Montag Hall (Georgia Tech)|Montag]], [[Fitten Hall (Georgia Tech)|Fitten]], [[Folk Hall (Georgia Tech)|Folk]], [[Caldwell Hall (Georgia Tech)|Caldwell]], Armstrong, Hefner, [[Fulmer Hall (Georgia Tech)|Fulmer]], and Woodruff Suites.<ref name="map"/> The [[Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center|Campus Recreation Center]] (formerly the Student Athletic Complex); a [[volleyball]] court; a large, low natural green area known as the [[Burger Bowl]]; and a flat artificial green area known as the CRC (formerly SAC) Fields are all located on the western side of the campus. 

West Campus is also home to a music club operated by students called [[Under the Couch]]. Also within walking distance of West Campus is City Cafe, which is open 24 hours, Rocky Mountain Pizza, and Engineer's Bookstore, an alternative to Georgia Tech's official bookstore.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/nique/article/504|title=Sticker shock? Get textbook deals for any budget|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2008-08-22|first=Jenny|last=Morgan|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> West campus is home to a convenience store, West Side Market. Due to limited space, all auto travel proceeds via a network of one-way streets which connects West Campus to Ferst Drive, the main road of the campus. Woodruff Dining Hall, or "Woody's", is the West Campus Dining Hall.<ref name=brittain/> It connects the Woodruff North and Woodruff South undergraduate dorms.

=== East Campus ===
[[File:Georgia Tech Skiles walkway.jpg|right|thumb|A view of Skiles Walkway from the Student Center, facing east|alt=A raised view of a large, grey sidewalk that extends from the center foreground to the background, with several people walking either away or toward the point of view. A building extends along the sidewalk from the right side of frame in the foreground, and dense, verdant foliage extends from the left side of the frame in the foreground. There are a few particularly large trees in the background, obscuring the view of the sidewalk. In the background on the left two large red brick buildings.]]
East Campus houses all of the fraternities and sororities as well as most of the undergraduate freshman dormitories. Although the residences are similar, East Campus is more urban than West Campus. East Campus abuts the [[Downtown Connector]], granting residences quick access to Midtown and its businesses (for example, [[The Varsity]]) via a number of bridges over the highway as well as a tunnel beneath it. Georgia Tech football's home, [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]] is located on East Campus, as well as Georgia Tech basketball's home [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]].<ref name="map"/> 

[[Brittain Dining Hall]] is the main dining hall for East Campus. It is modeled after a [[Gothic architecture|medieval church]], complete with carved columns and stained glass windows showing symbolic figures.<ref name=brittain/> The main road leading from East Campus to Central Campus is an ascending incline commonly known as "Freshman Hill" (in reference to the large number of freshman dorms near its foot) or simply "The Hill". On March 8, 2007, the former Georgia State University Village apartments were transferred to Georgia Tech. Renamed North Avenue Apartments by the institute, they began housing students in the fall semester of 2007.<ref name="NAA" />

=== Central Campus ===
